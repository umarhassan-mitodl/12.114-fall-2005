Up to now, the tectonic assemblage of western North America has been dominated by the accretion of terranes over the passive margin. After the period of passive margin sedimentation, the Antler material overthrust the margin, then the Havallah (with a small island arc) overthrust the Antler, then finally the Sonoma Terrane overthrust the Havallah. These events were broadly experienced across the edge of western North America as we find remnants of the tectonic events from southern California to Alaska. At the southern end of this continental margin we recognize that this sequence may have been truncated by what we believe to have been a large left lateral transform fault that offset the southern extension of the continental margin sequence into the region near Caborca, Mexico. Though the sequence is poorly exposed due to extensive cover beds of Cenozoic volcanics, there are exposures of rocks like those found in the western US. This truncation fault is important because it exposed the region the southeastern corner of the US as a continental margin. This continental margin was very different compared to the margin further north where the Passive Margin, Antler, Havallah and Sonoma materials bordered, covered and insulated the continental basement of North America. In the area where the truncation happened, the continental basement was directly exposed at the new raw margin and also was not covered by thick sequences of sediment. At this time, the continental margin also began to switch from a ‘West-Pacific’ style margin (where the tectonics are dominated by irregular collisions of island arcs and continental fragments) to an ‘Andean’ style margin (where the tectonics are dominated by steady subduction of oceanic crust beneath continental curst resulting in arc volcanism and back arc or marginal basins).

To the north in Canada we find the intrusive arc continues to emplace large igneous bodies. This is also true in the Mojave region in the southwest corner of north America, but as discussed earlier, the fold and thrust belt active along much of western NA is becoming less active to inactive in its central segment. In the southwest U.S., because most of the passive margin sequence was sheared off by the late Paleozoic truncation, the deformation is complicated by the presence of thick continental basement. The deformation is accomplished by much more ductile shear and metamorphism and a discontinuous and irregular fold and thrust belt. During the end Cretaceous, in between the Canadian arc and the Mojave region, the arc intrusions stop but the mélanges deposited in the accretionary wedges continue. Subduction remains active but the arc extinguishes…Why? Looking further east, you can see that large scale inter-continental deformation is occurring via block uplifts of Precambrian basement and deposition of sediments in adjacent basins within the cratonic rocks east of the former Paleozoic passive margin. It is suggested that these observations are a consequence of a change in the dip of the subducting slab. As the slab-dip shallows, subduction continues to build the accretionary wedge, but the down-going slab is not deep enough or hot enough to melt/dewater and produce igneous activity in the overlying mantle wedge. Where the slab does begin to dip, heat is concentrated against the base of the crust, but because the heat is applied to the base of thick continental crust, the deformational activity is expressed as the block uplifts rather than Arc volcanics forming the Laramide Colo-Wyoming Rocky Mountains. It is not known why the slab changed from steeply dipping to shallowly dipping, but research in northern Argentina (where there is also shallow-slab subduction), may shed light on this process.
