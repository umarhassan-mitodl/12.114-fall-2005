Inside are stoves, tables, food storage and lanterns for the evenings. We wash our own dishes and you can see them drying on the table. There is also a cooler for our veggies and drinks. As we are at a remote location in the desert, water is scarce. The red water cooler is for drinking during the day, but to be conserved when washing. There will be three showers during IAP or about once a week or 10 days. There will be mapping groups that will also have roles in the kitchen. These will alternate day-to-day, but each group will have responsibilities to help in food preparation and in washing kitchen dishes.

We purchased them with gracious support from the Kaplan Foundation. There is a lot of wind in the desert, especially at night and, our old tents were knocked over frequently.

Those groups responsible for breakfast preparation start a half hour early. We also make our lunches during breakfast time. This is your chow for the day and is very important to make a good lunch. The saying goes, “a geologist is never far from his/her lunch.” When doing field work it is never a good idea to leave your food or pack behind as you might intend to just run up quickly to one outcrop, but in the end you may end up getting excited and follow a feature half way across the field area before you realize it is time for lunch and your food is way back over there.

Plus, doing work in a new area means making a contribution to our geologic understanding of the southwest. This contributes to science.

It keeps the instructors curious and on their toes as well.
