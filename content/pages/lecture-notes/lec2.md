This means that the rocks are 600 million years old (ma) or more. In the NA Precambrian there are some blocks that are older than 2.5 billion years (by) old. You can also see in this map that there are younger Precambrian strips snaking between the larger blocks. These strips represent the mountain building events that happened as these older continental fragments slammed against one-another. They are now eroded down to a low relief surface, but can be recognized as the suturing together of the larger older continental (aka cratonic) blocks. In the south part of NA you can also see that there are some younger blocks that were added onto NA, and in these blocks you can see interesting places where parts of the blocks are missing. In particular, the western edge of NA seems to have been removed from many of the western Precambrian blocks. In this course we will emphasize how mountains are created through the process of first rifting (or tearing) apart of continents and creating ocean basins, and then fragments closing those basins as continents collide with one another. When we look at the age of the ocean floor across the globe, we see that the oldest oceanic crust that we can find is not much older than 200 million years. But in the continents, we see rocks that are up to 4 billion years old! That is because oceans are transient features that are born and destroyed and they are subducted beneath continents or accreted against their edges. This is a great thing, because that means that the earth’s history is recorded in the continents, not in the oceans…if it were the other way around, it would be tough, wet work doing geology. So, we can see from the way that the Precambrian continent is broken off on the western edge that there was rifting and the development of the passive margin sometime younger than 1 billion years.

These rock are some of the first sediments that were deposited along the western edge of the continent following rifting. They are 600-650 m.y. old and are not continuously outcropping along all of western NA, but can be interpreted to be the first sediments deposited near the passive margin. We will discuss these more with some slides to come. In the north here you can see a huge outcrop of older rocks, the Belt Group. They are 1.5 by to \<1 b.y. old. The Belt rocks are still a big puzzle because (1) the western half are heavily metamorphosed and difficult to interpret and (2) they are also a super-thick pile of sediment, up to 15 kilometers! How is this possible? We know that the only way that this was possible was that the crust was extremely thin so that the sediments could be deposited. The Belt group could have been deposited in a weak thin part of the crust that was associated with the rifting along the western edge of NA before the passive margin development at a later (~600-680 m.y.) time.

The sediments that you see with contoured thickness, thickening to the west are the first sediments deposited on the newly established rifted margin. This is also referred to as a “Passive Margin” as there is no active tectonic deformation driven by interactions between plates. In the passive margin setting, the only deformation is extensional and is a consequence of sediment-loading causing subsidence of the warm and weak western edge of the continent. We know roughly when the rifting happened because the first sediments (localities denoted with triangles) deposited onto the passive margin are sediment from the extensive late Precambrian glaciation. We will discuss these particular deposits in detail after a few more slides. The deposits on the passive margin thicken to the west, and are largely non-marine and nearshore clastic sediments, reaching thicknesses of up to 8 km! This great thickness reveals a couple of important things. First the sedimentation rates were extremely high and there was a great deal of sediment available from the continent to the east to be deposited on the new passive margin edge. But not only was there a high sedimentation rate, but the depositional environments were relatively consistent through time at a locality. This suggests that even though there was a good deal of sediment moving off the continent, the thinned basement rocks off the edge of the continent were subsiding rapidly, keeping the depositional interface at roughly the same elevation (thus the consistent depositional environment). It is the extensional rifting and the warm weak crust that allow for rapid subsidence following rifting. So as the continent is becoming loaded and thinned through extensional destruction of the continental edge, the continents are undergoing a constructional period as the sediment is accumulated on the margin. An interesting thing about this passive margin is that we can’t see a section continuous across strike leading to the distal, extreme western edge of the margin.

So this period is twice as long and the previous discussed one (200 vs. 100 my). During this period sedimentation continued on the passive margin with the same distribution as before, but in this period there are a number of differences. First, the sediments deposited are not as thick as from the last period (latest Precambrian to earliest Cambrian). Also the sediments are not near-shore non-marine, but are dominantly near-shore, shallow water, marine limestone. The sediments still thicken to the west with the hinge line still near Las Vegas.-------------The reason for many of these differences has to do with the increasing maturity of the passive margin. When the rifted edge of the continent was a relatively young feature, the thin crust and the high heat flow from the underlying mantle made the crust weak. This weak crust was susceptible to flexure and subsidence during cooling as the margin was loaded with early sediment, but during this period the crust has cooled more slowly and grown more rigid. This reduced the subsidence rate and subsequently the amount of accommodation space available for sediments. With limited subsidence, the thickness of the carbonate deposits were limited by sealevel and thus did not become tremendously thick.--------------Speaking of sea level, this period (Cambrian to Late Devonian age (550-350ma)) was also one of large fluctuations in sealevel and we can see in the sediments deposited on and east of the margin that the shoreline fluctuated broadly across western North America. The sediments deposited inland of the margin were thin but at times reach as far east as Wisconsin. Volcanic arcs began to develop within the PaleoPacific Ocean far from the North American continent. ---------------The fine grain distal marine deposits that were deposited off the continental rise during this time are not preserved in place, but rather were (at a later time) structurally thrust up and over the nearshore marine rocks (this will be discussed shortly).

During this period we find the western edge of NA switching from a passive margin to an active one where deformation due to subduction has thrust the distal sediments of a ‘phase 2’ age up and over the near-shore passive margin sediments. This mountain building event, called the Antler Orogeny and was driven by convergent mountain building whose origin remains a subject of much controversy. This constructed a large mountain range bounded on the east by the leading edge of the thrust (the Robert’s Mountain thrust). The loading of the crust due to the emplacement of the thrust sheet created a flexural depression in the crust (the Antler Foredeep) on the east side of the mountains.

The age of the distal sediments overthrust in the Antler Orogeny are the same as the near shore passive margin and the fossils within the distal sediment are also of North American affinity.
