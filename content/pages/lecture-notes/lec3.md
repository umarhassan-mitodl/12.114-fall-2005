In this image we see the sheared and folded deep water sediments of the distal Antler marine basin thrust over and emplaced on top of the shallow water deposits of the continental margin. It is uncertain how and why these deep water sediments were thrust up and over the continental edge extending from southern California to Alaska. We have a good idea that they were not transported much more than a few hundred kilometers as the sediments contain fossils of North American affinity but lack and volcanic or Arc materials. To understand the story of what happened when, we rely on the sediments deposited at the time that the events were occurring. The Antler foredeep (introduced in a previous lecture) records the sediments derived from the mountain building event that occurred as the deep-water sediment overrode the shallow sediments. In the foredeep, we see both sediments derived locally off the topographically high Antler thrust sheet and those from the long traveling continental rivers. The Antler sediments, transported from the west are composed of conglomeratic deposits composed of cherts, shales and other low-grade metamorphic rocks. This is the first time we see sediments derived from the west- a feature that indicates the first tectonic activity and mountain building in the west. Transported from the east, we find finer-grained, quartz-rich sediments that have traveled great distances (during transport, other minerals are eroded away, weathered or deposited, leaving quartz grains preferentially carried over large distances).

Banding or repeated crystal precipitation events suggests that the chemistry of the melt is changing in time as new magma enters the chamber or as the melt slowly cools.

This picture is from the area west of the Roberts Mountain Thrust in the Klamath Mountains of northern California. The typical stratigraphy of the ocean floor has to so with the changing depth of the seafloor as oceanic crust is created at the spreading ridge and moves away. Near the spreading ridge, the crust is warm and buoyant and at shallow enough depths that carbonate deposits are preserved. As the crust cools and moves away from the spreading center it is less buoyant and is found at deeper depths. As the depth increases, the temperature of the bottom waters decrease. The sediments found in these deep-water regions are mainly silicious deposits, such as chert, shown above. This is because carbonate’s solubility increases with decreasing temperatures. Though throughout the ocean, carbonate detritus created by marine microorganisms rains out of the water column, the deep parts of the ocean (which are cooler) lack carbonate sediment because the falling detritus dissolves before it can be deposited. The depth at which this happens is called the CCD or the Calcite Compensation Depth. Thus the stratigraphy of ocean floor sediments typically starts out as carbonates, but later become silicious. There sediments complete the makeup of oceanic crust. If we find all these components present on land, then we can call it an Ophiolite Sequence. Lets review. Peridotites and Dunites with metamorphic ductile fabrics are at the contact between the mantle and the crust. Above there are magna chambers with cumulate textures due to the progressive settling of crystals from the melt. Fed from the magma chamber, the sheeted dike complex is typically composed of many, many generations of near-vertical dikes. These dikes reach the surface and provide the magma erupted at the ocean’s floor as pillow basalts. Pelagic sediments form the top of the oceanic crustal sequence.

The island arc emplaced west of the Havallah sediments had an accretionary wedge on its western edge that contains marine sediments that range in age between Cambrian and Permian.
