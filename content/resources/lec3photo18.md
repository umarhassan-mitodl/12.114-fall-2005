description: In this slide we see the igneous rocks that intruded the edge of North
  America exposed by the late Paleozoic truncation fault. These granites are ~252ma
  and are overlain along an unconformable contact by conglomerates composed of the
  same granitic materials. This granite suggests that the edge of south-western North
  America were subject to subduction following truncation and formed the beginnings
  of a Continental Andean arc sometime before 252ma. Image courtesy of Professor Burchfiel.
