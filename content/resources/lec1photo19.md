description: "Some Final Considerations: (Lectured with out slides)----------There\
  \ are no weather reports where we will be. We deal with the weather we are given.-------We\
  \ use digital mapping tools to expedite the map-making process. Many maps have been\
  \ made in the past, but the process of getting those maps to publishable form is\
  \ to cumbersome, so many maps are never completed for others to see. We hope to\
  \ overcome that with these digital tools. The map we make will be in publication-ready\
  \ form at the end of the semester. Using digital tools in the field also allows\
  \ us to have multiple datasets available to us at the outcrop including Landsat\
  \ and other remotely sensed data.--------At the end of each day, we will be digitizing\
  \ our mapping results, adding both our point data and our line data into the GIS.\
  \ This way, each morning, we can print out a fresh map, summarizing all the other\
  \ group\u2019s work which helps us find holes and focus areas on the map.------------The\
  \ course layout: Dr. Burchfield will lecture the first half of the course about\
  \ the geology of the southwest US. In the latter part of the semester, the lectures\
  \ will focus on our specific field region. We will work mostly out of the GSA Decade\
  \ of North American Geology (DNAG) which summarizes the tectonics of the western\
  \ US. Courtesy of TA Ben Crosby."
