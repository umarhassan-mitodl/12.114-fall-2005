description: Here are our tent-sites spread across the desert at one camp. Tents MUST
  be strong and wind-proof and well staked down. Dome-style tents that are low to
  the ground are the best. One year, during the day, a gust of wind pulled one student's
  tent out from under its fly, and tumbled across the desert never to be found. We
  searched miles down wind and never found it. The sleeping bag was inside as well!
