description: This is an image of the camp set-up. There is a cook tent in the background.
  Inside are stoves, tables, food storage and lanterns for the evenings. We wash our
  own dishes and you can see them drying on the table. There is also a cooler for
  our veggies and drinks. As we are at a remote location in the desert, water is scarce.
  The red water cooler is for drinking during the day, but to be conserved when washing.
  There will be three showers during IAP or about once a week or 10 days. There will
  be mapping groups that will also have roles in the kitchen. These will alternate
  day-to-day, but each group will have responsibilities to help in food preparation
  and in washing kitchen dishes. Image courtesy of Professor Burchfiel.
