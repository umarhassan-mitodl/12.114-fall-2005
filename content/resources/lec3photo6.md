description: In this image we see where early Pennsylvanian sediments were deposited
  over the eroded interior of the mountains of the Antler Orogeny. This suggests that
  the topography created by the Antler was eroded to low relief that the Antler Orogeny
  was complete by the early Pennsylvanian. Image courtesy of Professor Burchfiel.
