From the low angle of the shadows you can see we start early in the day. Those groups responsible for breakfast preparation start a half hour early. We also make our lunches during breakfast time. This is your chow for the day and is very important to make a good lunch. The saying goes, “a geologist is never far from his/her lunch.” When doing field work it is never a good idea to leave your food or pack behind as you might intend to just run up quickly to one outcrop, but in the end you may end up getting excited and follow a feature half way across the field area before you realize it is time for lunch and your food is way back over there.
