description: In this image we see the layering of crystals that accumulate and precipitate
  out of the melt in a magma chamber. There are light colored trondhjemites and mafic
  peridotite but most of the cumulate in the chamber is a coarse gabbro. So in this
  image the layering is not by tectonics or metamorphism but rather my crystals setting
  out of the melt through time. The mafic minerals precipitate first, then sequentially
  other minerals rain out of the melt and accumulate on the floor of the magma chamber.
  Banding or repeated crystal precipitation events suggests that the chemistry of
  the melt is changing in time as new magma enters the chamber or as the melt slowly
  cools. Though there can be variations due to the influx of new magma, the general
  progressive trend toward cumulates that are more feldspar rich provides geologists
  with good right-way-up indicators, an important tool for geologists mapping in field
  areas with extensive deformation. Image courtesy of Professor Burchfiel.
