description: In this lecture we return to the Late Devonian/ Early Mississippian to
  discuss the Antler Orogeny. In this image we see the sheared and folded deep water
  sediments of the distal Antler marine basin thrust over and emplaced on top of the
  shallow water deposits of the continental margin. It is uncertain how and why these
  deep water sediments were thrust up and over the continental edge extending from
  southern California to Alaska. We have a good idea that they were not transported
  much more than a few hundred kilometers as the sediments contain fossils of North
  American affinity but lack and volcanic or Arc materials. To understand the story
  of what happened when, we rely on the sediments deposited at the time that the events
  were occurring. The Antler foredeep (introduced in a previous lecture) records the
  sediments derived from the mountain building event that occurred as the deep-water
  sediment overrode the shallow sediments. In the foredeep, we see both sediments
  derived locally off the topographically high Antler thrust sheet and those from
  the long traveling continental rivers. The Antler sediments, transported from the
  west are composed of conglomeratic deposits composed of cherts, shales and other
  low-grade metamorphic rocks. This is the first time we see sediments derived from
  the west- a feature that indicates the first tectonic activity and mountain building
  in the west. Transported from the east, we find finer-grained, quartz-rich sediments
  that have traveled great distances (during transport, other minerals are eroded
  away, weathered or deposited, leaving quartz grains preferentially carried over
  large distances). Image courtesy of Professor Burchfiel.
