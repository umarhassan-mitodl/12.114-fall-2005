description: We do our field work in the southwest United States in January. It is
  true that there is snow in the high mountains in the desert at that time but we
  will not work that high. We try to work in snow-free regions. There is a lot of
  walking. As the regions we are mapping are often not accessible by car, we will
  walk in and out each day so it is important to be in good shape. Images courtesy
