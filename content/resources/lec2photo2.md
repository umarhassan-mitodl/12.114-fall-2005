description: This image depicts the two major tectonic provinces in western North
  America. On the west are accreted terranes of Paleozoic to Cenozoic age. Each terrane
  is composed of fragments of oceanic or continental material that were created somewhere
  away from North America, but were then tectonically accreted or attached to the
  western edge during subduction or translation along strike slip faults. This material
  built out the western edge by accreting island arcs or continental fragments translated
  here from far away (exotic) or close by North America (indigenous). ------------------------
  On the Eastern half are the older passive margin sediments that were largely eroded
  from the eastern old part of North America and transported westward and deposited
  at the western edge of North America. Image courtesy of Professor Burchfiel.
