description: This image is from Death Valley, well west of the hinge line. The pile
  of Cambrian sediments here are ~3000 meters of carbonate rocks are represent only
  a small portion of the rocks that represent the same time period we just looked
  at in the Grand Canyon. While in the east the sequence is ~200 meters thick, the
  same sequence in the west is greater than up to 10,000 meters thick! This is what
  subsidence can do! Image courtesy of Professor Burchfiel.
