description: This slide focuses on rocks of Cambrian to Late Devonian age (550-350ma).
  So this period is twice as long and the previous discussed one (200 vs. 100 my).
  During this period sedimentation continued on the passive margin with the same distribution
  as before, but in this period there are a number of differences. First, the sediments
  deposited are not as thick as from the last period (latest Precambrian to earliest
  Cambrian). Also the sediments are not near-shore non-marine, but are dominantly
  near-shore, shallow water, marine limestone. The sediments still thicken to the
  west with the hinge line still near Las Vegas.-------------The reason for many of
  these differences has to do with the increasing maturity of the passive margin.
  When the rifted edge of the continent was a relatively young feature, the thin crust
  and the high heat flow from the underlying mantle made the crust weak. This weak
  crust was susceptible to flexure and subsidence during cooling as the margin was
  loaded with early sediment, but during this period the crust has cooled more slowly
  and grown more rigid. This reduced the subsidence rate and subsequently the amount
  of accommodation space available for sediments. With limited subsidence, the thickness
  of the carbonate deposits were limited by sealevel and thus did not become tremendously
  thick.--------------Speaking of sea level, this period (Cambrian to Late Devonian
  age (550-350ma)) was also one of large fluctuations in sealevel and we can see in
  the sediments deposited on and east of the margin that the shoreline fluctuated
  broadly across western North America. The sediments deposited inland of the margin
  were thin but at times reach as far east as Wisconsin. Volcanic arcs began to develop
  within the PaleoPacific Ocean far from the North American continent. ---------------The
  fine grain distal marine deposits that were deposited off the continental rise during
  this time are not preserved in place, but rather were (at a later time) structurally
  thrust up and over the nearshore marine rocks (this will be discussed shortly).
