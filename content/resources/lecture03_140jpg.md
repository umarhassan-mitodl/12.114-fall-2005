description: In this slide, we see the location of the eastern limit of the arc-related
  plutons. They trace across the entire western edge of the plate margin, suggesting
  that Andean-style subduction was active throughout most of the Mesozoic. An over-riding
  theme in this story of the Arc environment is HEAT. This is the driving factor for
  most of the structures that we observe. In the subduction zone environment, the
  isotherms are depressed where cold rocks of the subducting plate go down but to
  the east they are juxtaposed against the hot intrusive Arc environment. Moving further
  in-board from the arc, the rocks progressively cool to within the fold and thrust
  belt, finally returning to normal temperatures in the undeformed basement. This
  heat in the arc provides a possible mechanism for consuming the foot-wall of the
  antithetic fold and thrust belt, but it is hard to locate where this might be happening.
