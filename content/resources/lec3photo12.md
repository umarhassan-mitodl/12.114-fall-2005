description: As you move up through the oceanic crust, you leave the magma chamber
  and enter the sheeted dike complex. This region is composed of a collection of vertically-oriented
  basalts in dikes, but there are so many that this region is almost entirely composed
  of dikes. In this image you can see one of these darker dikes cutting up and left
  though a basaltic rock that is just composed of dikes itself. The darker rocks are
  along the dike margins due to rapid cooling against lighter-colored rocks near the
  middle of a previously intruded dike. The extension responsible for creating the
  fractures that the dikes travel up is due to the tectonic instability of the region
  adjacent to the mid-ocean ridge. Image courtesy of Professor Burchfiel.
