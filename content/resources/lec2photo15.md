Here is an image from the Grand Canyon. Remember, we are east of the hinge line. In the image we see 1.6 – 1.8 by basement rocks overlain by non-marine and marine rocks that span the early Cambrian to the Devonian…but here the section is only several hundred meters thick. Younger Mississippian rocks make up the upper cliffs. Image courtesy of Professor Burchfiel.
